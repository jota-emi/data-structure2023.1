        "As you dive into the world of coding interviews, you may find it to be a notoriously difficult journey, especially when it comes to Big Techs coding interviews. However, I encourage you to embrace the challenge and not be discouraged by the initial difficulty. Preparing for the coding interview is one of the most frustrating, discouraging, and annoying things, but it can also be one of the most rewarding experiences of your career.\n",
        "\n",
        "While it is true that there are scarce materials in the internet to prepare for coding interviews, do not let this discourage you. You have the opportunity to push yourself to new heights, and with the right mindset and attitude, you can achieve your goals. Understanding complex algorithms from a book can be very difficult, but with patience and persistence, you can make progress. It may be challenging to understand long coded solutions, but remember that practice makes perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, many of the books available are written in C++ and Java only, but don't let that hold you back. With the right guidance and resources, you can gain a deep understanding of these languages and master the material. As your teacher, I am committed to helping you better understand the solutions in these books. We will work together to identify areas where you may need additional support and explore different resources to aid your learning.\n",

        "When you come across academic PDFs, or when you desperately try to find videos on YouTube, know that you are not alone. Many students face similar challenges, and it is natural to feel frustrated at times. However, I encourage you to persist and push through these challenges. Remember that every step you take is a step closer to achieving your goal.\n",

If the value of p1 is smaller than the value of p2, then can just \"move forward\"in the first Linked List by moving p1 and p1Prev forwared by one position (p1Prev becomes p1 and p1 becomes p1.nex). If the value of p1 is greater than the value of p2, then you need to insert p2 before p1. You'll have to first make p1Prev point to p2, then make p2 point to p1, all the while not losing track of p2's \"next\"node, which you'll need to move to right after. You'll also have to handle edge cases when you're dealing with head and nodes or tail nodes. \n",

Loop in the opposite direction that the buildings are facing, and keep track of the maximum building height that you've seen.

Finally, at each iteration, update the running maximum.\n",

Loop in the direction that the buildings are facing, and add the index of the current building to the stack at the end of each iteration. Before adding elements to the slack, compare the current building height to buildings at the top of the stack. Pop off the top of the stack until the current building height is shorter than the height of the building at the top of the stack. This will remove all buildings the are blocked from seeing the sunset by the current building. At the end of the algorithm, the stack will only contain elements that can see the sunset.\n"
